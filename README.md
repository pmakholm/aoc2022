# Advent of Code 2022

This is a set of solutions to [Advent of Code
2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

Solutions are mainly written in quick and dirty Perl. No points for
maintainability, no points for being overly smart.

One-liners are comitted as shell scripts. At times my original solution
involved manual steps, this has been documented in comments. Otherwise
no comments has been added to explain the code. Debug output has been
retained.
